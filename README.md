# 🧠 AI Translator App using Hugging Face and Gradio

## 📌 Project Description

This is a simple interactive translator application that uses a pre-trained machine translation model from [Hugging Face 🤗](https://huggingface.co) and integrates it with a user-friendly interface using [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/). The goal is to demonstrate the ability to use pre-trained models and deliver an intuitive translation experience.

## 🧩 Project Details

### 1. Model Used

- **Model Name:** `Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-ar`
- **Model Function:** Translates text from English to Arabic.
- **Model Source:** [Hugging Face Model Link](https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-ar)

### 2. App Use Case

This application takes English text input from the user and returns the Arabic translation. It’s useful for users who want a quick translation tool without needing to copy/paste into large services.

### 3. Gradio Interface

- **Input Component:** `Textbox` – For entering English text.
- **Output Component:** `Textbox` or `Label` – Displays the translated Arabic text.
- The interface is minimal and focused on easy usability.

### 4. Integration and Testing

The model was integrated with Gradio and tested locally to ensure functionality. Users can input text and immediately see translated output in Arabic.

> Optional: You can deploy the app to [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) for public access.
